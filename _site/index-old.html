    <p>
      From Phoenix, Arizona, Jenny Chang attended Arizona State University to pursue Interior Architecture. From Tucson, Arizona, Edouard Urcadez attended Arizona State University to pursue Industrial Design. Their paths crossed on campus and they made things official on 09-09-09.
    </p>
    <p>
      In four years, Edouard moved to Austin and Jenny joined shortly after.  They began their careers as designers.
      They have shared a love for art, design, culinary shows, lazy beach trips, and their cat Whiskey.
    </p>
    <p>
      After seven years, Jenny and Edouard currently live in New York with Whiskey.  They plan to spend the rest of their lives together.

      The wedding will be held on the rooftop of a building drafted in the early 1930s, in the Fashion District of New York City.

      It is wrong to say that there is no arguing about taste when it is good taste
      that is in question. We are not born with good taste, nor do we come into this
      world equipped with a real understanding of art. Merely to recognize who or
      what is represented in a picture has little to do with a real under- standing
      of art. Neither has an uninformed opinion about the proportions of Roman
      letters. In any case, arguing is senseless. He who wants to convince has to
      do a better job than others.
