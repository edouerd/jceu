      From Phoenix, Arizona, Jenny attended Arizona State University to pursue design. She is currently a Designer in New York City at an international architecture firm. She met Edouard when she needed a to use someone's printer and a friend asked, "Have you met Eddy?" One of her favorite memories was getting drawings from him left on her door.

      It is wrong to say that there is no arguing about taste when it is good taste
      that is in question. We are not born with good taste, nor do we come into this
      world equipped with a real understanding of art. Merely to recognize who or
      what is represented in a picture has little to do with a real under- standing
      of art. Neither has an uninformed opinion about the proportions of Roman
      letters. In any case, arguing is senseless. He who wants to convince has to
      do a better job than others.
